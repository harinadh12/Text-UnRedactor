My Mother █████ begins as a warm, amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (█████, short for ███████, played by █████████████) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (██████████████), who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend (██████████). Meanwhile █████ has raised the ire of her disapproving English tutor (██████████████ /><br />██████████████ is utterly disarming as █████; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character's uptight. He generates valuable goodwill, steering the audience through some of the film's more awkward, broad comedy moments. Not long after the half-way point, first-time writer-director █████████████ expertly steers his film into darker emotional territory and gives ██████ a real chance to shine.<br /><br />The supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces (██████████████, ████████████, ███████████████) and all the principals (including a more animated than usual █████████) are excellent. While it meanders a little towards the end, My Mother █████ delivers more than it promises and is a genuine Australian crowd-pleaser.
