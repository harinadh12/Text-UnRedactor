This movie was the second movie I saw on the cinema as a child. It scared the living crap out of me. So much so that I asked my father if we could leave halfway through.<br /><br />Nowadays, the only people leaving halfway through are the ones who have a good taste in movies.<br /><br />I, however, still have fond memories of this flawed masterpiece of awfulness. ████████████ and █████████████ in the same movie! Great! Monsters made of polypropylene substitute. Scary stuff. A rubber monster is, when you think about it, is even scarier than a real monster.<br /><br />The astonishing thing about this movie is how good the score is. Truly rousing stuff.<br /><br />There's also plenty of prehistoric tit on show, too. Nice.
